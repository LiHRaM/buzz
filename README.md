# Introduction

This version of Buzz uses the [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org) configuration language instead of TOML, and outputs JSON to standard output instead of interfacing with any system trays.

See [`buzz.dhall`](./buzz.dhall) for an example of the configuration.
You must place yours in your configuration folder, e.g. `~/.config/buzz.dhal` on Linux.
